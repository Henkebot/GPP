	<b>Command</b>
	"Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations"
	The command pattern is simply that you make a class for a command that your code need such in a gaming application, move. This move is made into an command that will be created when needed. This "move object" is passed and can be stored for future undo and later executed to perform its purpose.
	Code is located in /Command folder
